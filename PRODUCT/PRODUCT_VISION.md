# PRODUCT VISION

## Deutsch ist einfach! — Quiz Arena (Telegram Bot)

---

## 1. Purpose & Vision

**Deutsch ist einfach! — Quiz Arena** is a Telegram-native game product for learning German through competition, habit, and social interaction.

This is **not** a quiz bot and **not** a course.
It is a **skill-based game ecosystem** where learning happens as a side effect of play.

**Vision statement:**

> Become the most engaging and viral German-learning game on Telegram, transforming daily practice into competition, status, and habit.

## 2. Core Product Principles (Non‑Negotiable)

1. **Game first, learning second** – no lessons, no long explanations, no friction.
2. **One bot, one identity** – single player profile, single history, single ranking.
3. **Progressive complexity** – users never see everything at once.
4. **Skill-based competition only** – no gambling, no monetary prizes.
5. **Telegram-native UX** – short sessions, buttons, instant feedback.
6. **Scalable by design** – same engine usable for other languages later.
